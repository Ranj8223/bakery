        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the Oven:Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line two baking sheets with
                 parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li> Mix Dry Ingredients:In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda.
                 Set aside.</li>
            <li> Cream the Butter and Sugars:In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat
                 the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy.
                 This will take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Add Eggs and Vanilla:Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
                 Then add the vanilla extract and mix until incorporated.</li>
            <li> Add Dry Ingredients:Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined.
                 Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li> Stir in the Chocolate Chips:Fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li> Scoop the Dough:Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, scoop out the dough and place 
                 it onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie,
                 as they will spread while baking.</li>
            <li> Bake:Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown,
                 but the centers are still soft.</li>
            <li> Cool:Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes.
                 Then, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!:Once the cookies have cooled, they’re ready to enjoy with a glass of milk or your favorite drink!</li>
