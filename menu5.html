        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the Oven:Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners</li>
            <li> Prepare Dry Ingredients:In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
                 Set it aside.</li>
            <li> Cream Butter and Sugar:In a separate large bowl, beat together the softened butter and sugar
                 with an electric mixer (or by hand if you’re up for it) until it’s light and fluffy.
                 This will take about 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li> Add Eggs and Vanilla:Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
                 Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li> Add Dry Ingredients:Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until
                 just combined. You don’t want to overmix it!</li>
            <li> Add Milk:Pour in the milk and mix gently until the batter is smooth and fully combined.</li>
            <li> Fill the Cupcake Liners:Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about
                 2/3 full with batter.</li>
            <li> Bake:Place the cupcake tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick
                 inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
            <li> Cool:Let the cupcakes cool in the tin for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to
                 cool completely.</li>
            <li> Frost:Once they’re cool, frost with your favorite frosting (buttercream, cream cheese frosting,
                 or chocolate ganache are all great options!). Decorate as you like.
                
                Enjoy your delicious homemade cupcakes! Would you like a frosting recipe to go with them?</li>
