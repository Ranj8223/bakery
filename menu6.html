        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Prepare the Cake Batter:Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
                 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease it.</li>
            <li> Mix the Wet Ingredients:In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs
                 and sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened.
                 This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer orwhisking 
                 vigorously by hand.Add the vanilla extract if you're using it and mix well.</li>
            <li> Combine the Dry Ingredients:In a separate bowl, sift together the flour,
                 baking powder, and salt.Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet
                 mixture. Be careful not to overmix—just gently incorporate the flour until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li> Add Butter and Milk:Mix in the melted butter and milk until everything
                 is well combined. This will add moisture and softness to the batter.</li>
            <li> Bake the Cake:Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it out evenly.
                 Bake for about 8-10 minutes, or until the cake is lightly golden and a toothpick
                 inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li> Cool the Cake:Allow the cake to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet,
                 then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li> Shape the Cakes:Once cooled, use a round cutter (about 3 inches in diameter)
                 to cut the cake into circles.
                 You should get about 10-12 circles depending on the size of your cutter.</li>
            <li> Add the Red Bean Paste Filling:Take one circle of cake and spread a generous
                 spoonful of sweet red bean paste (anko) on the flat side of the cake.
                 Top with another cake circle, flat side down, to create a sandwich.</li>
            <li> Serve:Gently press the edges together so the cake holds. Repeat with the
                 remaining cake circles and red bean paste.Serve and enjoy!

                 Dora cakes are best enjoyed fresh, but you can store them in an airtight
                 container for a couple of days if needed. They’re soft and sweet with a
                 lovely balance of the fluffy cake and creamy red bean filling. Enjoy your homemade Dora cakes!</li>
