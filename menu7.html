        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Mix the Ingredients:In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, sugar,
                 vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until the sugar is fully dissolved.</li>
            <li> Churn the Ice Cream (if using an ice cream maker):If you have an ice cream maker,
                 pour the mixture into the machine and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
                  This typically takes around 20-25 minutes, and the mixture will start to thicken as it freezes.</li>
            <li> Without an Ice Cream Maker (No-Churn Method):If you don’t have an ice cream maker,
                 pour the mixture into a shallow dish (like a 9x9-inch pan).
                 Then, place the pan in the freezer and stir the mixture every 30 minutes
                 to prevent ice crystals from forming. Continue stirring until it reaches a smooth,
                 creamy consistency (this may take 3-4 hours).</li>
            <li> Freeze:Once the ice cream has thickened (either from churning or stirring in the freezer),
                 transfer it into an airtight container and freeze it for at least 4 hours,
                 or overnight for the best texture.</li>
            <li> Serve:After the ice cream has fully set, scoop it into bowls or cones,
                 and enjoy your homemade vanilla ice cream!</li>
